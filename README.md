<h2>Hi, I’m Shahiduzzaman Shahin 👋</h2>
I’m a dedicated IT System Engineer and Android App and Web Application Developer with 9 years of experience building, deploying, and managing reliable technology solutions across enterprise and mobile environments. I have a strong background in designing and maintaining secure, scalable infrastructure on both Linux and Windows platforms.

Alongside system engineering, I specialize in Android application development using Java and Android Studio. I build end-to-end mobile solutions with REST API integration, MySQL databases, and Laravel-based backends, focusing on performance, security, and clean architecture. My system-level experience helps me design Android apps that integrate smoothly with backend services and scale with business growth.

I enjoy solving real-world problems through technology and delivering stable, user-friendly solutions that align with business needs.
